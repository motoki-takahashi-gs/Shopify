## url-from-item-code
This code is to automatically get URLs of product pages whose item ID is written in a CSV file called "items.csv". Once the code is executed, a Chrome browser will be launched and get URLs based on item ID, and another CSV file called "url_list_with_itemCode.csv" with item IDs and URLs will be created.
